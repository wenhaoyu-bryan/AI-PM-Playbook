## Core Competencies of an AI PM

### 1. Architectural Thinking

**Definition**: Understanding how systems work, defining component boundaries and data flows.

**Key Abilities**:
- Define system boundaries
- Design component interfaces
- Reason about data flows
- Evaluate technology choices

**Practice Methods**:
- Draw architecture diagrams before writing code
- Define clear API interfaces
- Clarify data flows and dependencies

**Examples**:
- Ontology OS: Neo4j as data source, NetworkX as computation engine, LLM as reasoning layer
- Fab Agent Space: React frontend + mock data + component-based design

---

### 2. Prompt Engineering

**Definition**: Designing instructions for AI so that it understands your intent and produces high-quality results.

**Key Abilities**:
- Translate requirements into instructions AI can understand
- Design clear constraints and acceptance criteria
- Handle edge cases and errors

**Practice Methods**:
- Describe requirements in a structured way
- Provide concrete examples and counterexamples
- Specify technical constraints and limitations

**Prompt Design Principles**:
1. **Clear**: Use concise language to describe requirements
2. **Specific**: Provide concrete examples and constraints
3. **Complete**: Cover all edge cases
4. **Verifiable**: Define clear acceptance criteria

---

### 3. Quality Assessment

**Definition**: Evaluating the quality of AI output, identifying potential issues and risks.

**Key Abilities**:
- Identify code quality issues
- Detect architecture design flaws
- Assess performance and security risks
- Decide when human intervention is needed

**Practice Methods**:
- Establish quality checklists
- Test critical functionality and edge cases
- Verify the validity of architectural decisions

**Quality Check Dimensions**:
- Functional correctness
- Edge case handling
- Performance
- Security

---

### 4. Rapid Validation

**Definition**: Quickly validating requirements and hypotheses, verifying ideas at minimal cost.

**Key Abilities**:
- Design minimum viable products (MVPs)
- Rapidly generate prototypes
- Collect user feedback
- Iterate and optimize

**Practice Methods**:
- Use AI to rapidly generate prototypes
- Have users try and provide feedback
- Iterate quickly based on feedback
- Validate core assumptions

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Does the core functionality solve the user's problem?
- [ ] Is the interaction flow smooth?
- [ ] Are users willing to use it?
- [ ] Is there business value?
